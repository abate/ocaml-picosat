ocaml bingings for picosat
==========================

The package provides an example, solver.ml, that reads from standard input a
formula and print its satisfiability and a satisfying assignment (if any). A
formula is a sequence of lines that either define a variable ('v' <name>),
define a clause ('c' followed by a sequence of names, with a leading '-' if
they are negated in the clause) and comments (starting with '#'). A couple of
example formulas are available in the 'examples/' directory.

for documentation refer to picosat.h and picosat.mli
